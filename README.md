# Strava Procedural Heatmap

This project is a web application that uses Leaflet and the Strava API to sequentially display a user's runs on a map, gradually building a heatmap.

It consists of:
- A backend written in Python using FastAPI ([Backend README](backend/README.md))
- A frontend written in React ([Frontend README](frontend/README.md))

## Running the Project

To build and run the project, use:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the individual README files in the respective `backend` and `frontend` directories.
